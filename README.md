# \~Retro\~ Tracker!

This app allows a user to select a date and it will display the songs from the top 50 viral chart on that particular day that were released more than 20 years before. It shows "old" songs that came back to be popular on the selected day.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# To Run:
## Start the Client:

In the project directory, you run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Start the Server:

In a separate terminal from the retro-tracker/ folder:

### `cd src/api`
### `flask run`

The server should now be up and running.

Now make your first date selection!
